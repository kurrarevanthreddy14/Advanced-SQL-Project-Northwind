# Advanced-SQL-Project-Northwind
## Project Objective
This project demonstrates proficiency in advanced SQL by querying the classic Northwind relational database. The goal was to extract actionable business insights by answering a wide range of business questions related to customers, employees, orders, and products. The queries showcase a range of SQL techniques including multi-table JOINs, LEFT JOINs, aggregate functions with GROUP BY and HAVING, and conditional logic with CASE statements.

## Dataset
This analysis uses the standard **Northwind** sample database, which models the sales data for a fictional specialty foods import/export company called "Northwind Traders." The database includes interconnected tables for `Customers`, `Orders`, `Employees`, `Products`, `Suppliers`, and more.

## Tools Used
* **Database:** SQLite
* **Querying Tool:** DB Browser for SQLite

## Business Questions & SQL Queries

This analysis answers several key business questions. The full, commented script is available in the `northwind_analysis_queries.sql` file in this repository.

### 1. What is the date range of the orders in the dataset?
* **Objective:** An initial exploratory query to understand the time span of the data.
* **Technique:** Uses `MIN()` and `MAX()` aggregate functions on the date column.
```sql
SELECT
    MIN(OrderDate) AS FirstOrderDate,
    MAX(OrderDate) AS LastOrderDate
FROM
    Orders;
```
### 2. How many orders were placed per quarter?
* **Objective:** To analyze business activity and identify sales trends over time.
* **Technique:** Uses a `CASE` statement with date functions to create custom groupings for each fiscal quarter and year.
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN strftime('%m', OrderDate) IN ('01', '02', '03') THEN strftime('%Y', OrderDate) || '-Q1'
        WHEN strftime('%m', OrderDate) IN ('04', '05', '06') THEN strftime('%Y', OrderDate) || '-Q2'
        WHEN strftime('%m', OrderDate) IN ('07', '08', '09') THEN strftime('%Y', OrderDate) || '-Q3'
        WHEN strftime('%m', OrderDate) IN ('10', '11', '12') THEN strftime('%Y', OrderDate) || '-Q4'
    END AS OrderQuarter,
    COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
GROUP BY OrderQuarter
ORDER BY OrderQuarter;
```
### 3. Which customers have never placed an order?
* **Objective:** To identify potential leads or inactive customers.
* **Technique:** Uses a `LEFT JOIN` to find all customers who do not have a corresponding entry in the `Orders` table.
```sql
SELECT
    c.CustomerID,
    c.CompanyName
FROM
    Customers c
LEFT JOIN
    Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
WHERE
    o.OrderID IS NULL;
```
### 4. Which employees are top performers (handled > 100 orders)?
* **Objective:** To identify top-performing employees based on the volume of orders processed.
* **Technique:** Uses `COUNT` to aggregate the number of orders and the `HAVING` clause to filter the results *after* grouping.
```sql
SELECT
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName,
    COUNT(o.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM
    Employees e
INNER JOIN
    Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
GROUP BY
    e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
HAVING
    COUNT(o.OrderID) > 100
ORDER BY
    NumberOfOrders DESC;
```
### 5. What is the total cost for each order?
* **Objective:** To calculate the revenue generated by each order, including discounts.
* **Technique:** Joins multiple tables and performs a `SUM` on a calculated column (`UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - Discount)`).
```sql
SELECT
    o.OrderID,
    SUM(od.UnitPrice * od.Quantity * (1 - od.Discount)) AS TotalOrderCost
FROM
    Orders o
INNER JOIN
    OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
GROUP BY
    o.OrderID
ORDER BY
    TotalOrderCost DESC;
```
### 6. Which orders were shipped late?
* **Objective:** To identify operational inefficiencies in the shipping process.
* **Technique:** Uses a date comparison in the `WHERE` clause.
```sql
SELECT
    OrderID,
    RequiredDate,
    ShippedDate
FROM
    Orders
WHERE
    ShippedDate > RequiredDate;
```
### 7. Which products are supplied by 'Exotic Liquids'?
* **Objective:** To filter products based on their supplier.
* **Technique:** A simple `INNER JOIN` with a `WHERE` clause.
```sql
SELECT
    p.ProductID,
    s.CompanyName,
    p.ProductName
FROM
    Products p
INNER JOIN
    Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID = s.SupplierID
WHERE
    s.CompanyName = 'Exotic Liquids';
```
### 8. Who was the customer and employee for each order?
* **Objective:** To create a consolidated view of order details for reporting.
* **Technique:** A three-table `INNER JOIN` to link orders to customers and employees.
```sql
SELECT
    o.OrderID,
    c.CompanyName,
    e.FirstName,
    e.LastName
FROM
    Orders o
INNER JOIN
    Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
INNER JOIN
    Employees e ON o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID;
```
